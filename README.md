PingedIn
================

Indirectly gain attention for your profile by visiting the pages of users who fit certain criteria. You see them, they see you.


The new limitations of LinkedIn limit the effectiveness of the code to First 100 profiles or pages. Changing the URL to Start from 100 can partially resolve the issue. 

The loop is updated to sync with linkedin's limits for a free user. The script can now ping up to 300 users at a time. The script might throw an error if the number of profiles for a search are less than 250.

Please modify the for loop to desired number.
